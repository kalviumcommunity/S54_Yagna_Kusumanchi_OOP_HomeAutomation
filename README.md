# **Home Automation System Simulation**

## 📚 **Project Description**

The **Home Automation System Simulation** is a console-based Java application that simulates smart home devices like lights, fans, and air conditioners. This simulation mimics a smart home environment where various devices can be turned on or off, their settings can be adjusted (e.g., light brightness or fan speed), and the status of each device can be monitored.

The primary goal of this project is to demonstrate Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts using Java while simulating a real-world scenario. It showcases essential OOP features like classes, objects, inheritance, method overriding, encapsulation, and more.

## ⚡ **Key Features**

- **Smart Devices**: Simulate various smart devices like lights and fans with real-world behavior.
  - **Light**: Turn the light on/off and adjust its brightness level.
  - **Fan**: Turn the fan on/off and adjust its speed.
  
- **Device Status Monitoring**: Display the current status (e.g., ON/OFF, brightness level, fan speed) of all devices.
  
- **Robust OOP Structure**:
  - **Inheritance**: Common functionality is shared using a base `Device` class.
  - **Method Overriding**: Derived classes (`Light`, `Fan`) override the base class methods to provide device-specific behavior.
  - **Encapsulation**: Devices manage their own internal state (e.g., on/off, brightness, speed) through class methods.

## 🛠️ **Technology Stack**

- **Programming Language**: Java
- **IDE**: Any Java-compatible IDE (IntelliJ, Eclipse, VS Code, etc.)

## 🧑‍💻 **Getting Started**

### **Prerequisites**

To run the Home Automation System Simulation, ensure you have the following installed on your machine:

- Java Development Kit (JDK) 8 or higher
- A Java-compatible IDE (e.g., IntelliJ IDEA, Eclipse, or VS Code)

### **How to Run the Project**

1. **Clone the Repository**:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/kalviumcommunity/S54_Yagna_Kusumanchi_OOP_HomeAutomation.git
    ```
   
2. **Open the Project in Your IDE**:
   - Import the project into your preferred IDE as a Java project.

3. **Run the Main Program**:
   - Navigate to the `HomeAutomationSystem.java` file.
   - Run the file to start the simulation.

## 📝 **Usage**

### Interacting with Devices

Once the project is running, the following actions will be performed:

- **Creating Devices**: Smart devices such as `Light` and `Fan` are created and initialized with their attributes.
- **Turning Devices ON/OFF**: Each device can be turned on or off.
- **Adjusting Device Settings**: You can adjust specific device settings like light brightness or fan speed.
- **Displaying Device Status**: The current status (ON/OFF, brightness, speed) of each device will be displayed in the console.

## 🚀 Future Enhancements
- Add more smart devices like Air Conditioner and Smart Door Locks.
- Implement Automated Device Control based on environmental conditions (e.g., turning on lights at night).
- Add a User Interface to control the devices via a graphical interface.
- Introduce voice commands for interacting with smart devices.
